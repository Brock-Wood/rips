==DGW Activation==

Activation of Dark Gravity Wave (version 3) with a 3 hour window to prevent difficulty oscillations caused by multipool adding and removing hashpower on difficulty swings.

This will be activated by the BIP9 activation process which consists of a start time, end of 2016 block cycle, voting cycle(s), lock-in, and activation.
